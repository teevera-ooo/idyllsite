    <p>idk what this site is going to be yet exactly but i’m excited to start sharing a whole bunch of stuff on here.
        i guess the name “idyll cloud” is pretty vague. am i aiming for some kind of idyllic organization around art? yea
        a lot of us really want the process to be idyllic, to not be constrained by commodity and capital and all that.
        there’s gonna be a bunch of resources n links to other projects/sites run by people who know a whole lot more than me. hopefully we can start getting archives and blog posts set up here soon. i wanna make a forum too but idk how active it’ll be at first lol. the discord is basically that.</p>

    <p>for now... the discord is up  /ᐠ –ꞈ –ᐟ\
